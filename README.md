# Introduction
Accurate determination of position has become very important in recent years. To estimate the GNSS receiverâ€™s position at any time, one determines the four unknown parameters, that is, the X, Y, Z coordinates of the receiver and its clock error. This project focuses on the implementation of kinematic single point positioning (KSPP). A software module for conducting kinematic SPP using Kalman filtering is developed using GPS pseudorange measurements
